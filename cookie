Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
3/4 cup brown sugar (packed)
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Cream the butter and sugars: In a large bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).
Add eggs and vanilla: Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla extract.
Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
Stir in chocolate chips: Fold in the chocolate chips with a spatula.
Scoop dough: Use a spoon or cookie scoop to form dough balls, placing them on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake: Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
